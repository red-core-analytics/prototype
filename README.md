# Prototype
This is a prototype for a web application that I will be building.
<br>
The frontend of this web application is totally HTML.
<br>
On the backend, there might be some things like Django.

## Objective
If possible, I will host this web application.
<br>
Ideally, this needs to be dynamic.
<br>
I believe we can avoid that dynamism temporarily.

## Plan
I will start writing this once I am done with the Python libraries.
<br>
This is a good reason for writing some frontend.
